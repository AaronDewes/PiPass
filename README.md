# PiPass - Nintendo 3DS Homepass for the Raspberry Pi

PiPass turns your Raspberry Pi into a Nintendo 3DS Homepass Relay Station. The PiPass Dashboard can manage most of the features without the need of opening up any files manually. Though there are some setting up to do that will require getting your hands 'dirty'.

Given you have a compatible WiFi adapter that can be used as an Access Point, PiPass should be able to run on any version of the Raspberry Pi and even on a Linux computer. I have tested PiPass on a Raspberry Pi 2
