# List of 3DS MAC addresses that are allowed to authenticate with PiPass.
# Since Nintendo Zones only work as a open network, we can use this file
# to keep the network techncally open, but only allow an approved list of
# devices to connect. This provides some security to your network and prevents
# others from connecting.
#
# Type in each 3DS MAC address on a seperate line, like the following.
#
# 00:11:22:33:44:55
# 00:66:77:88:99:aa
# 00:00:22:33:44:55
#
# Insert 3DS MAC addresses below this line, without the #.
